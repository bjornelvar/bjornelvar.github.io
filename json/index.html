With a simple command like squad_dataset = load_dataset(&quot;squad&quot;), get any of these datasets ready to use in a dataloader for training/evaluating a ML model (Numpy/Pandas/PyTorch/TensorFlow/JAX),\nefficient data pre-processing: simple, fast and reproducible data pre-processing for the above public datasets as well as your own local datasets in CSV/JSON/text. With simple commands like tokenized_dataset = dataset.map(tokenize_example), efficiently prepare the dataset for inspection and ML model evaluation and training.\n\n"

You can paint the platforms and the tiles around you to make the player jump higher, climb up walls or just go faster. The game was designed and programmed in 2 weeks.\nThis game was part of the 3-week course Computer Game Design and Development at Reykjavik University. The course was taught by Steingerður Lóa and our group was invited to present our game and to represent Reykjavik University at the UT Messan event in Reykjavik.\n"

The objective is to keep hitting the ball, bouncing it back and forth between yourself or your friendly UFO. This game was created in the first week of the 3-week course Computer Game Design and Development at Reykjavik University.\nI wanted to make this game as zen as possible and I believe I achieved that. I wanted the game to never increase in difficulty, but rather to be a relaxing experience completed by the background music and sound effects.\n"

I of course didn't have any workflow for it, so I decided to build one myself. I used the NBA API to get the data and then built a workflow around it using Python. And a lot of JSON parsing.\nIf you're interested in that kind of stuff, you can check out my Github repository.\nHow to use it:\n\nAn Alfred Powerpack is required. (Sorry)\nDownload the workflow from Alfred Gallery.\nDouble click it to install.\nType nba in Alfred.\nPress enter or use the built-in hotkey on a game to see the box score or summary.\n\nExamples\n\n\nCredits\n\nNBA API\nKristjana Ósk for asking me what games were on tonight.\n\n"

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first toolkit to support six Chinese NLP fundamental tasks. \n"
